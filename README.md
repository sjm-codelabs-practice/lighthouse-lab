# lighthouse-lab

Following along with / completing Google developers training lighthouse codelabs.

## Resources
* https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/lab-auditing-with-lighthouse

## Notes
* http-server package has been added to server this labs pages
  - this server did work successfully when serving pages to a browser on the same machine,
  but didn't successfull server over the LAN to my phone
    + note, there could be command line options to resolve this
  - lighthouse successfully worked (locally)
* using the google extension web server, the pages served successfully both locally and over the LAN (and for lighthouse as well)
* add to home screen, it works! when using Safari on iPhone, cool.
